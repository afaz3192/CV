  <p>I am a research assistant from Concordia University. The objective of the research work was to investigate and propose appropriate physics-based models for x-ray detectors designed with Organic Perovskite Materials. Currently, I am looking for possible opportunities that relate with simulations and analysis of semiconductor materials and other electrical systems. I also did an internship at a substation situated in Dhaka, Bangladesh where I had the practical experience of handling high-voltage electrical equipments.</p>
